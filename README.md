- **TUI configuration interface** with real-time preview
- **Theme system** with multiple built-in presets
- **Segment customization** with granular control
- **Configuration management** (init, check, edit)

### Claude Code Enhancement
- **Context warning disabler** - Remove annoying "Context low" messages
- **Verbose mode enabler** - Enhanced output detail
- **Robust patcher** - Survives Claude Code version updates
- **Automatic backups** - Safe modification with easy recovery

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

Install via npm (works on all platforms):

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @cometix/ccline

# Or using yarn
yarn global add @cometix/ccline

# Or using pnpm
pnpm add -g @cometix/ccline
```

Use npm mirror for faster download:
```bash
npm install -g @cometix/ccline --registry https://registry.npmmirror.com
```

After installation:
- ✅ Global command `ccline` is available everywhere
- ⚙️ Follow the configuration steps below to integrate with Claude Code
- 🎨 Run `ccline -c` to open configuration panel for theme selection

### Claude Code Configuration

Add to your Claude Code `settings.json`:

**Cross-Platform (Recommended)**
```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.claude/ccline/ccline",
    "padding": 0
  }
}
```

> **Note for Windows users:** Starting from Claude Code v2.1.47+, Unix-style path parsing is supported on Windows. The `~` symbol is automatically expanded to your user home directory. **Do not use `%USERPROFILE%`** - it no longer works reliably in v2.1.47+.
> - Recommended: `~/.claude/ccline/ccline` (works on all platforms)
> - Alternative: `"ccline"` (requires npm global installation)

**Fallback (npm installation):**
```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "ccline",
    "padding": 0
  }
}
```
*Use this if npm global installation is available in PATH*

### Update

```bash
npm update -g @cometix/ccline
```

## Default Segments

Displays: `Model | Effort | Directory | Git Branch Status | Context Window`

### Git Status Indicators

- Branch name with Nerd Font icon
- Status: `✓` Clean, `●` Dirty, `⚠` Conflicts  
- Remote tracking: `↑n` Ahead, `↓n` Behind

### Model Display

Shows simplified Claude model names:
- `claude-3-5-sonnet` → `Sonnet 3.5`
- `claude-4-sonnet` → `Sonnet 4`

### Context Window Display

Token usage percentage based on transcript analysis with context limit tracking.

### Effort Display

Shows the current reasoning effort level reported by Claude Code, such as `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`. Requires Claude Code 2.1.119 or later. The segment is omitted when the input has no `effort` field. All built-in themes enable Effort after Model.

## Configuration

CCometixLine supports full configuration via TOML files and interactive TUI:

- **Configuration file**: `~/.claude/ccline/config.toml`
- **Interactive TUI**: `ccline --config` for real-time editing with preview
- **Theme files**: `~/.claude/ccline/themes/*.toml` for custom themes
- **Automatic initialization**: `ccline --init` creates default configuration

### Available Segments

All segments are configurable with:
- Enable/disable toggle
- Custom separators and icons
- Color customization
- Format options

Supported segments: Directory, Git, Model, Effort, Agents, Context Window, Usage, Session, Cost, Output Style, Update

### Effort Configuration

Run `ccline --config`, select **Effort** in the segment list, and press **Enter** to toggle it independently of Model. Use **Tab** to edit its icon, colors, background, and text style, **Shift+Up/Down** to reorder it, and **S** to save `config.toml`. The preview updates as you edit. **W** writes to the current theme file, which is used when launching with `--theme`.

If your configuration or selected theme does not contain Effort, the TUI presents it as a disabled option after Model (or at the end when Model is absent). Effort uses a lightning icon and its own purple palette for the selected built-in theme; custom themes use the default Effort appearance. Press **Enter** to enable it, then **S** to save the configuration or **W** to write the current theme. The added Effort option is written only when you save. You can also configure the segment directly in `config.toml` or a theme file:

```toml
[[segments]]
id = "effort"
enabled = true
icon = { plain = "⚡", nerd_font = "\uf0e7" }
colors = { icon = { c16 = 13 }, text = { c16 = 13 } }
styles = { text_bold = false }
options = {}
```

Set `enabled = false` to hide Effort. The value comes directly from the statusline input's `effort.level`; ccline does not infer it from model names, thinking settings, or token usage.

### Subagent Activity

**Agents is disabled by default in every built-in theme.** Run `ccline --config`, select **Agents**, press **Enter** to enable it, then **S** to save. Saving installs the `SessionStart`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, and `SessionEnd` command hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`. If there is no status line configured, it also configures ccline as the status line. An existing status line command is preserved. When no `refreshInterval` is configured, ccline adds a two-second refresh so background activity updates while the main session is idle.

Disable **Agents** and press **S** to uninstall its hooks. Other hooks and settings are preserved. A refresh interval added by ccline is removed on uninstall if it is still unchanged; an existing or subsequently edited interval is preserved. Unsaved edits only affect the preview. **W** and **Ctrl+S** save theme files without changing the hook installation; **S** applies the activity toggle. Configurations and themes without an Agents entry show it as a disabled option in the TUI.

While observed subagents are active, the main status line shows a summary such as `Agents: 2 active · 1 responded · Explore 35s · reviewer 1m20s`. When no subagents are active, or no events have been observed, the entire segment is hidden, including its separator. Use **Tab** to edit the active text color, icon, background, and text style, and **Shift+Up/Down** to reorder the segment. The TUI preview uses example activity even when the current session is idle.

Activity is keyed by session ID and agent ID, with process locking for concurrent hook events. Repeated starts do not increase the count, a resumed agent starts a new elapsed-time measurement, compaction preserves activity, and starting or resuming a session resets that session's observations. Each fresh installation uses a separate state directory under `~/.claude/ccline/agents/`; re-enabling does not reuse records from a previous installation. The installation manifest is `~/.claude/ccline/agents-installation.json`.

The summary reflects [official lifecycle hook events](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#subagentstart). `responded` means a `SubagentStop` event was observed, not that a task succeeded. These hooks do not reliably distinguish waiting for permission, failure, cancellation, or continuation requested by another stop hook, so the segment uses the configured active color instead of inferring those states. An interruption without an end event cannot be confirmed from this data. Agents that were already running before installation are not reconstructed from transcript files. Malformed state or settings files produce explicit errors.

### Model Configuration (`models.toml`)

Location: `~/.claude/ccline/models.toml` (auto-created on first run)

This file configures how model IDs are displayed and their context window limits. Claude models (Sonnet, Opus, Haiku) are automatically recognized with version extraction — you only need this file for overrides or third-party models.

```toml
# Model entries: simple substring matching on the model ID
# These take priority over built-in Claude model recognition
[[models]]
pattern = "glm-4.5"
display_name = "GLM-4.5"
context_limit = 128000

[[models]]
pattern = "kimi-k2"
display_name = "Kimi K2"
context_limit = 128000

# Context modifiers: matched independently and composable with model entries
# Overrides context_limit and appends display_suffix to the display name
# e.g., model "Opus 4" + modifier " 1M" = "Opus 4 1M"
[[context_modifiers]]
pattern = "[1m]"
display_suffix = " 1M"
context_limit = 1000000
```


## Requirements

- **Git**: Version 1.5+ (Git 2.22+ recommended for better branch detection)
- **Terminal**: Must support Nerd Fonts for proper icon display
  - Install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (e.g., FiraCode Nerd Font, JetBrains Mono Nerd Font)
  - Configure your terminal to use the Nerd Font
- **Claude Code**: For statusline integration

## Development

cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Build optimized release
cargo build --release
```
